Hi! 
I made this blog to publish some Enstars translations that I originally made for myself, but I thought it might be useful to others as well! I am no Japanese expert though, so some TLs may be rough, but please bear with me ヽ(；▽；)ノ (or you can check out others instead!) Translations will be mostly Yuzuru or Ibara focused.
